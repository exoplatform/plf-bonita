Getting Started
---------------

There are 3 sample portals included with eXo Platform. We encourage you to play with them in order to discover the features that you can leverage in your own project.

    * The default Welcome portal is a single-page application with resources to help you explore and begin to use eXo Platform. It also serves as a "blank portal" that can be customized for your own use.
    * From the Welcome portal, you can also access two sample implementations from a fictitious company, Acme Industries:
          o The Acme Website (dev/samples/acme-website/)shows how the powerful content management features of eXo Platform help build a better user experience for customer-facing web apps.
          o The Acme Social Intranet (dev/samples/acme-intranet/) demonstrates eXo Platform's capabilities within an enterprise collaboration environment. It can be easily serve as the starting point for your own Social Intranet application.
