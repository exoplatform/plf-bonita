h1. Preamble

PLF 3.0 provides a set of tools to migrate system data from your BOS-5.5 standalone instance to your new PLF 3.0 + Bonita instance.

So the entire old package will not be used, but it will serve as a backup of his old system.

h1. Requirements

. BOS-5.5 standalone server
. Platform + Bonita server

In this document we will use *<BOS-Server>* for BOS-5.5 standalone server and *<PLF-Server>* for Platform + Bonita server.

h1. Install the migration libraries

_This section provides step-by-step instructions for the backup procedure from a running BOS 5.5 standalone to Platform + Bonita._

# Stop the running BOS-Server.
# Copy the the BOS Migration Tool library, located in _/bos/lib/exo.platform.migration.bos.tool-<VERSION>.jar_ into the xcmis lib directory of BOS-Server.
# Start again the BOS-Server, in the log file (i.e: <BOS-Server>/logs/catalina.out) you should see a message indicating that the backup service is started:
{code}
BOSBackupService: BOS Backup Service started
{code}
# Access the server via _JMX_: in this example we will use _jconsole_ as a JMX client.
# Choose *exo* > *platform* > *bonita-ext* > *BOSBackupService* MBeans.
. We will proceed for the backup in a chosen location, say */exo-work/BOS-5.5/backup/*
# In the _JMX_ client, fill the _backupLocation_ field with appropriate value: */exo-work/BOS-5.5/backup/cmis1*
!bos/jconsole1.png!
# Hit *doBackup*, you should see a *Method successfully invoked* message
!bos/backup-ok.png!
.In the log file (i.e: <BOS-Server>/logs/catalina.out) you should see a message indicating the backup success:
{code}
BOSBackupService: Starting the backup operation.. Repository: db1
BOSBackupService: Full backup succeeded: /exo-work/BOS-5.5/backup/system/db1_system-20110608_061330.0
BOSBackupService: Full backup succeeded: /exo-work/BOS-5.5/backup/cmis1/db1_cmis1-20110608_061330.0
{code}

. The backup procedure is now finished, we will go for a restore operation from the PLF-Server.
# Copy the whole backup folder */exo-work/BOS-5.5/backup/* to <PLF-Server>/temp
# Use the configuration archive located in _/bos/config/exo.platform.migration.bos.config-<VERSION>.zip_ and extract it in "<PLF-Server>/gatein/conf".

# Start your server.
. You should see that the workspaces are well initialized from the restore files
