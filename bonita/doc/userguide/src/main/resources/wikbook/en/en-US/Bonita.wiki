Consider a scenario where a user named "admin" creat a document and wants to publish it. So this must be approved by "James" and published by "Mary ".

# The user "admin" goes  to the "SiteExplorer" and adds a document named "Test" after he saved it , he clicks on the button "Request Approval":

After clicking on "Request approval", the button disappears and a message displays to inform the creator that his Approval request sent and the state of the Document change from "Draft" to "Pending" which means that the document is now submitted for approval to the auditors:

This screen is composed of:

* Title of the Document.

* A field for the auditor for commenting the document. This comment will be sent to the publisher of document when the auditor clicks on "verified" and stocked in the "Last Comments".

h2. {anchor:_Toc288484689}{anchor:_Toc292457555}Presentation

The second sample workflow is called "Leave Application". This is a classic hr process commonly implemented in many companies to manage employees vacations requests.

This sample, shows that, not only content-publication workflows can be integrated, but any type of business process can be smoothly integrated into "Platform for Bonita".

The diagram below illustrates the different steps of this process.

!images/worddav659a686e755a232598ac4bb3eeefda90.png|height=374,width=622!

*Figure 14:Leave Application Process*

The steps of the process involve:

* *Leave Application Submission* : The employee fill the application form for leave.


* *Manager's Approval* : The manager of the employee receives the form and gives an approval decision.

if the manager approves, the process passes to "Administrator's" approval, otherwise, the process passes to the "Reject" step.

* *Administrator's Approval* : after the agreement of the manager, the administration (typically HR department) records and the employee leave.


h2. {anchor:_Toc292457556}Scenario


Consider a scenario where "james" wants to take a leave. His manager is "admin" and the HR administrator is "john".

* James clicks on the "Leave Application" found in "Process List" in the homepage.
