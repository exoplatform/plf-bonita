h1.{anchor:_Toc297897628}Quick Start 
Unzip the Platform for Bonita tomcat bundle, and execute the "start_eXo" script found at root. Use "start_eXo.bat" for Windows and "start_eXo.sh" for Linux or Mac OS/. 
h2.{anchor:_Toc297897629}Configure Bonita server hostname 
eXo must know where the Bonita server is located to interact via the REST api. This is controlled by two system variables set in "gatein.sh" (gatein.bat) script. By default, Platform for Bonita will use the embedded engine on localhost. For a simple local evaluation you should not need to change it. But if you want to install it on a public server, you may need to adjust the variables: 

gatein.bat 
{code}
set BPM_HOSTNAME=localhost 
set BPM_HTTP_PORT=8080 
{code}
gatein.sh 
{code}
BPM_HOSTNAME=localhost 
BPM_HTTP_PORT=8080 
{code}
